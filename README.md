# Salesforce Apex SDK for the USPS Address API

This project aims to be a comprehensive Salesforce Apex SDK for the [USPS Address API](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm).

*This screenshot is from the USPS Address API Demo App that is located at `unpackaged/config/demo-app`. The demo app is not included in the Unlocked Package.*

## Getting Started

To work on this project in a scratch org:

1. Register for a [USPS Web Tools API Portal Account](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/welcome.htm)
2. [Set up CumulusCI](https://cumulusci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)
3. Run `cci flow run dev_org --org dev` to deploy this project.

### USPS Address API Username

After you register for a USPS Web Tools API Portal Account, you will be emailed a `USPS Username`. Create a new USPS Address API Setting Custom Metadata record using that username:
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Label | `USPS Username` |
| USPS Address API Setting Name | `USPS_Username` |
| Value | `Your Username` |

## Flow Support

This SDK includes an Action that can be used in Flow Builder: `USPSAddressAPIInvocable`. Be sure to review the `Validate Address - Flow Example` Screen Flow that is included in the demo app for an example of how to use this Action.

### Validate Address - Flow Example

![Screenshot of the full Validate Address - Flow Example screen flow](images/Full_Flow_Screenshot.png "Validate Address - Flow Example screen flow")

*This screenshot is from the USPS Address API Demo App that is located at `unpackaged/config/demo-app`. The demo app is not included in the Unlocked Package.*

### 1. Input Screen

Create a screen and use the standard Address input component.

### 2. Assign USPS Request

Create an Apex-Defined Variable of type `USPSRequestAuraEnabled`.

![Screenshot of Apex-Defined Variable of type USPSRequestAuraEnabled](images/USPSRequestAuraEnabled_Variable.png "Apex-Defined Variable of type USPSRequestAuraEnabled")

Create an Assignment, and assign the `USPS_Request` variable equal to the inputs from `Input_Address`.

### 3. Create an Apex Action

Search for `Validate Addresses using the USPS Address API` in the Action Search. Pass the `USPS_Request` variable into the Action's `Single Address to Validate` input. If you'd like to validate multiple addresses, build a ***collection*** of `USPSRequestAuraEnabled` variables and pass that into the Action's `Multiple Addresses to Validate` (not pictured).

### 4. Output Screen

Create a screen and, again, use the standard Address input component. This time, specify the values of the fields with the `Validated Single Address` output from the `Validate_Shipping_Address` Action. If you validated multiple addresses, you can loop through the Action's `Validated Multiple Addresses` (not pictured).

## Apex Support

There are three different USPS Address APIs that are exposed in this SDK:
1. Address Validation
2. ZIP Code Lookup
3. City State Lookup

### [Address Validation](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm#_Toc110511810)

> Corrects errors in street addresses, including abbreviations and missing information, and supplies ZIP Codes and ZIP Codes + 4.

You will probably use this API the most. In fact, this is the API exposed in the Invocable Method that ships with this SDK.

You can validate a single address by building a `USPSAddressValidateRequest` object.
```
USPSRequest address = new USPSAddressValidateRequest()
.setAddress2('415 Mission Street')
.setCity('San Francisco')
.setZip5('94105');

USPSResponse response = new USPSAddressAPIService().send(address);

Assert.areEqual('415 MISSION ST', response.street, 'C! A! P! S! CAPS CAPS CAPS!');
```

You can validate multiple addresses by building `List<USPSAddressValidateRequest>` objects.
```
USPSRequest address1 = new USPSAddressValidateRequest()
.setAddress2('415 Mission Street')
.setCity('San Francisco')
.setZip5('94105');

USPSRequest address2 = new USPSAddressValidateRequest()
.setAddress2('1 Apple Park Way')
.setCity('Cupertino')
.setZip5('95014');

List<USPSRequest> addresses = new List<USPSRequest>{address1,address2};

List<USPSResponse> responses = new USPSAddressAPIService().send(addresses);

Assert.areEqual('SAN FRANCISCO', responses[0].city, 'üåâ');
Assert.areEqual('CUPERTINO', responses[1].city, 'Ô£ø');
```

By default the Address Validation API returns a subset of fields in it's response. If you'd like for the API to return all of the fields, call the `setReturnAllData()` method.
```
USPSRequest address = new USPSAddressValidateRequest()
.setAddress2('415 Mission St')
.setCity('San Francisco')
.setZip5('94105');

USPSResponse response = new USPSAddressAPIService().setReturnAllData().send(address);

Assert.areEqual('Zip+4 information indicated this address is a building. The address as submitted does not contain an apartment/suite number.', response.footnotesDetails[0], 'Be sure to check out the demo app for a glimpse at all of the returns.');
```

### [ZIP Code Lookup](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm#_Toc110511817)

> Returns the ZIP Code and ZIP Code + 4 corresponding to the given address, city, and state.

You can validate a single address by building a `USPSZipCodeLookupRequest` object. You can also validate multiple addresses by building a request list.
```
USPSRequest address = new USPSZipCodeLookupRequest()
.setAddress2('415 Mission St')
.setCity('San Francisco')
.setZip5('94105');

USPSResponse response = new USPSAddressAPIService().send(address);

Assert.areEqual('2533', response.zip4, 'Well, hello Zip+4.');
```

### [City State Lookup](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm#_Toc110511824)

> Returns the city and state corresponding to the given ZIP Code.

You get the picture: use `USPSCityStateLookupRequest`.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Bulkification Warning

Be aware that the USPS Address API can only validate 5 addresses at a time, so the callouts are batched accordingly. If you build 10 request objects, you will consume 2 callouts. If you build 501 request objects, [your transaction will fail](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_callouts_timeouts.htm). This warning applies to both ***Flow Support*** and ***Apex Support***.
